- Offer expert opinions and suggestions in the field of strategy.
- Recommend and review documents, reports, and datasets related to strategy.
- Participate in project planning and the definition of key milestones.

## Information Designer
Bridge the gap between data, information, and knowledge by transforming strategic knowledge into knowledge representations, ensuring the effectiveness of the knowledge graph.

- Design and optimize the structure and semantic models of the knowledge graph.
- Provide frameworks and methods for knowledge representation to ensure the scalability and flexibility of the knowledge graph.
- Participate in the construction and optimization of the knowledge graph to ensure the accuracy and consistency of knowledge representation.

## Data Engineer
Establish and maintain datasets, extract various entities and relationships based on models, and provide data support for the knowledge graph.

- Construct and optimize datasets to ensure data accuracy and completeness.
- Use NLP/ML/LLM technologies to extract entities and relationships.
- Provide data processing and analysis tools and scripts to help the project team efficiently handle data.
